# SSBF File Format

SSBF (Simple Secure Binary Format) is a lightweight file format specification designed for embedded systems. Its primary focus is on fast and simple decoding in C, while providing essential features like compression, encryption, and data integrity verification. The block-based structure makes it ideal for network transfers and streaming applications.

## Key Features

- Minimal memory footprint with fast decoding
- Built-in data compression support
- Encryption and integrity checking capabilities
- Stream-friendly parsing with predefined data sizes
- Extensible user metadata support
- Block-based structure for efficient network transfer

## File Structure

```
|--------------------|
| Main Header        |
| Encryption Header  |
| Encryption Payload |
| Metadata Header    |
| Metadata Payload   |
| Data Header        |
| Hash (MAC)         |
|--------------------|
| Block 0            |
| ...                |
| Block N            |
